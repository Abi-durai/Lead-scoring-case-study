# Lead-scoring-case-study
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.

Problem statement:An X Education need help to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
